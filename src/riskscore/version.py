__version__ = """1.5.0"""

# v1.5.0: Fixed Sharp2019. Kinda. Its still wonky, and has trouble matching the alleles properly. But it works with some hand-holding.

# Notes and TODOs:

# TODO: When reading from VCF we should include an option for selecting the field you want; eg GT or DS, etc.
# TODO: The filtering isn't complete in pkcsv. I only filter '#' at the beginning, but we should do it in the whole file.
